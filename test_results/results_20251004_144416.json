    "answer": "ðŸ¤– Here is your answer:\n\nThe tone of Article 1 is informal and playful, with a mocking tone towards the content of the article. The writing style is casual and comedic, using sarcasm and exaggeration to convey the summary. For example, using phrases like \"This is a mocked summary of the article\" indicates a light-hearted approach.\n\nOn the other hand, Article 2 has a more neutral and straightforward tone. The writing style is formal and professional, presenting the summary in a clear and concise manner. There is no sarcasm or humor used in the summary, and the language is more serious. For example, the summary simply states the information without any added commentary or jokes. \n\nOverall, Article 1 takes a more casual and humorous approach to summarizing the content, while Article 2 maintains a formal and objective tone. These differences in tone, formality, and writing style can impact how the information is perceived by readers and can attract different audiences based on their preferences."

The summaries provided do not provide enough information to make a comparison in terms of positivity and sentiment. \n\nHowever, if we were to assume that both summaries are written in a neutral tone and do not show any explicitly positive or negative language, we can only conclude that both articles potentially have a similar level of positivity. \n\nTo provide a more accurate analysis, it would be necessary to have access to the full content of the articles in question."
