    "answer": "ðŸ¤– Here is your answer:\n\nThe tone and writing style of the two articles differ significantly. \n\nArticle 1 has a more critical and cautionary tone, highlighting the potential risks and lack of legal protections for users when using ChatGPT as a therapist. The writing is formal and technical, focusing on the absence of a legal or policy framework for AI. The perspective in this article is more focused on the potential negative implications of using AI in therapy.\n\nOn the other hand, Article 2 has a more neutral and informative tone, simply stating the appointment of Shengjia Zhao as the chief scientist of Meta's AI superintelligence unit. The writing is less technical and more straightforward, providing a brief summary of the appointment without delving into potential implications or risks. The perspective in this article is more focused on the announcement of a new appointment within Meta's AI division.\n\nIn terms of specific examples, Article 1 uses phrases such as \"lack of legal confidentiality\" and \"absence of a legal or policy framework for AI,\" which highlight the potential risks and lack of protections for users. On the other hand, Article 2 simply states the fact of Shengjia Zhao's appointment without delving into any potential risks or implications. \n\nOverall, Article 1 takes a more critical and cautionary approach, while Article 2 takes a more neutral and informational approach."
